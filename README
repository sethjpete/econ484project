All deliverables are in the Training folder.

The following deliverables are included in the Training folder:

Model_Creator.ipynb
-- This is the Jupyter Notebook that was used to create the model.
-- THIS IS THE MAIN DELIVERABLE FOR THE ASSIGNMENT.

** Model_Creator imports clean_data.book_cleaner.py
book_cleaner.py
-- This class is used to clean the data for the model.
-- Particularly, it strips common words, spaces, and other symbols from the data.

** Model_Creator uses the following datasets:
-- training_set.csv (found in the Training folder)
---- This is the dataset that was used to train the model. This dataset is comprised of hand-classified books, matching NYT to GoodReads/ SPL.
---- This dataset is generated from Imported/import_data.ipynb
------ Imported/import_data.ipynb imports the data from its own folder and the Exported/HW/ folder.
-- exported_models/goodreads.csv
---- This is the same dataset found in GoodReads/books.csv, but it is moved for convenience.
-- exported_models/Small_SPL
---- This is the same dataset used in the hand-classified "master" dataset. It is moved for convenience.



Book_Comparer.py
-- This is the extra program that compares the books and outputs the results.
-- This program is not required for the assignment, but it is a fun extra program.

** Book_Comparer imports clean_data.book_cleaner.py
** Book_Comparer uses pre-generated models found in exported_models
** exported_models models are generated in Model_Creator.ipynb
